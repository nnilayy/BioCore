## üåü Overview

BioCore is a modern, integrated platform that combines three powerful modules for bioinformatics research:

### 1. üî¨ Bio-Molecular Conformational Explorer

Core Features:

I. **PDB Integration & Structure Fetching**
   - Retrieve protein structures in real-time from the Protein Data Bank directly using their unique PDB IDs

II. **Interactive 3D Visualization & Styling**
   - Dynamic 3D visualization of bio-molecular structures with adjustable viewing styles and interactive controls for detailed exploration of the proteins

III. **Detailed Protein Structural Information**
   - Displays comprehensive structural metadata (classification, deposition date, title, R-values) including experimental methods (X-ray diffraction, NMR) and resolution metrics (resolution, R-free, R-work)
   - Provides detailed molecular information about protein chains and their source organisms
   - Includes bibliographic references with complete citation details for research attribution

IV. **Export Features**
   - Facilitates direct PDB file download for offline access and further analysis

### 2. üß¨ Proteomic Sequencing Analytics Dashboard

Core Features:

I. **Analysis of Proteins from FASTA Files**
   - Process protein sequences to generate general file-level statistics and specific protein analysis using interactive Plotly visualizations

II. **General File-Level Analysis**
   - Statistical exploration of sequence properties including length metrics and distributions, coupled with metadata insights on organism diversity and protein evidence levels, alongside global amino acid composition patterns

III. **Specific Protein Analysis**
   - Deep dive into individual proteins through biochemical characterization (molecular weight, pI, stability metrics), structural element predictions, and detailed amino acid compositional breakdown

### 3. üîç Genomic Ontology Navigator

Core Features:

I. **Interactive Hierarchical DAGs for Genomic Ontologies**
   - Process OBO files to create interactive networks of related Gene Ontology terms, exploring their hierarchical relationships across biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components

II. **GO Term Metadata Analysis**
   - Extract and analyze metadata of GO terms (IDs, names, definitions, relationship types) from OBO files
